# Topic Modeling in R <a name="intro"></a>
Topic modeling workshop in R, data and scripts. The workshop goes through *topic modeling*; (tweaking) the *Gibbs sampler*; using and editing a *stoplist*; linguistically inform the model using *Part-of-Speech*, *Lemmatization* and *key-words*; finding the appropriate *number of topics* (hello K!); and, finally, *exporting model results* to the extra-R world (if there is such a world). Bonus scripts (6-7) include code to build and app that will let you *interact with the model and the original data* at the same time and some *eye-candy* if you have the need to impress someone with your results.

A very brief introduction to topic modeling can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UPmCKOCR35Bv7atY15pSILNm_HxR_t62IHMkmU-fKa8/edit?usp=sharing).

# Learning and Modeling Philosophy <a name="learning"></a>

In this workshop we adopt the learning philosophy of [Fast AI](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/). Rather than starting off with the typical “Hello World” and building from ground up (which would take years of training), we start in the other end with state-of-the-art modeling, using very practical, (re-)usable examples. Many of the finer details of both the scripts and the underlying statistical “machinery” will, with this approach, be hard to get immediately, *but that is ok*: scripts and data are written and organized in such a way that each participant can return to whatever section of the workshop that has been unclear to gain a better understanding by themselves. The scripts are plentifully commented and the only command ever needed is ctrl+enter.

This is a *friendly, inclusive*, workshop. We believe that *trying* is the right thing to do, *even when you fail*. We thus *encourage everyone* who is interested to participate, regardless of prior knowledge. Should you feel that you need more preparations (theoretical, technical, or otherwise), that will not be the end of the world.
